# UnderStance Backend
Built with ExpressJS. Run with:
```
npm install
node backend.js

(requires mysql database running on host 3306)

Or use docker compose:
```
docker compose -f ../compose.yaml up // binds to port 3000 on host
// or use the test config:
docker compose -f ./tests/setup/docker-compose.test.yml up // binds to port 3001
```

## Testing
Tests are run using jest. To run the unit tests:
```
npm test
```

To run the full suite of tests:

**Note**: The integration tests spin up containers using docker to perform tests with. This means that you likely require elevated privileges to prevent permission errors with docker when running the test.

npm run testcov

Coverage files are generated in ./coverage
