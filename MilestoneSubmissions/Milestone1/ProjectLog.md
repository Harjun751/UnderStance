# Project Log
Will update this as we go, and clean this up for the submission on 2nd June. As it stands, it's just a rough outline.

## 20th May - Scrum initial meeting
We decided to go with Scrum as the framework of our development. To this effect, we did an initial meeting before we started the Sprint. We chose to use Jira to faciliate scrum processes, and we filled up the project backlog with user stories, and added the user stories we intended to complete this sprint.

We decided to keep the Sprint from now till the end of the milestone, which was about 2 weeks. We did a quick planning poker to set the story point estimations on the tasks that we assigned to sprint 1.

We decided to conduct daily scrums for 15 minutes every 5pm everyday, and with that we were ready to begin development.
